# Create your own github repo
# Add a .py file
# Create a simple version of an agent based simulation, based on the code in the last lecture, and the github repo linked at the end
# 1. Create an Agent class
# 2. Create a World class
# 3. Initialize the world
# 4. Create a loop
# Ask each agent in sequence to find an empty patch
# Move the agent to the empty patch
# 5. End
# Keep it simple (small grid, small number of agents, small number of loops), and utilize the code from the more complex example given in lecture.
